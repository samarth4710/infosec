Cryptography Algorithms Implementation
Overview
This Python project focuses on the implementation of classical and modern cryptographic algorithms. The implemented algorithms include the Caesar cipher, substitution cipher, RSA encryption, and Diffie-Hellman key exchange. The project aims to enhance understanding and practical application of cryptography concepts through hands-on coding.

Implemented Algorithms
Caesar Cipher:

Functionality for both encryption and decryption.
User input for messages and shift keys.
Substitution Cipher:

Randomly generated key for encryption and decryption.
User-friendly interface for message input.
RSA Encryption:

Generation of public and private keys.
Encryption and decryption of messages using RSA algorithm.
Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange:

Calculation of public keys and shared secrets.
Encryption and decryption using shared secrets.
How to Use
Select Algorithm:

Run the program and choose the desired cryptographic algorithm from the menu.
Follow User Prompts:

For each algorithm, follow the user prompts to input messages, shift keys, keys for substitution, or prime numbers.
Review Output:

The program provides encrypted and decrypted messages, as well as relevant keys and shared secrets.
